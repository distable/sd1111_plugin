# sd1111_plugin
A StableDiffusion plugin for stable-core based on the implementation by AUTOMATIC1111.

It is heavily refactored, trimming as much of the superfluous features as possible (upscalers, color correction, styles, ...) Keeps all of the optimizations and should be expected to perform the same as AUTOMATIC1111's webui.
